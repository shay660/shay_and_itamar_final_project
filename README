The script design to predict degradation rate of mRNA in the cell according to
it's sequence using linear regression model.


To use this script, follow these steps:

1. If you want to generate a new matrix for the model the command line should
be:
    python3 main.py model_number* alphas_list** name_of_the_matrix model_name
    path_to_samples_file path_to_responses_file min_size_of_kmer
    max_size_of_kmer
    

    For Example:
    python3 main.py 1 0.001,0.002,0.003 samples_with_polyA_matrix
    late_onset_with_polyA_model data/Table_S1_reporters.txt data/3U.models.3U.40A
    .seq1022_param.txt 3 7

2. If you want to run the script with an existing matrix:
    python3 main.py model_number* alphas_list** name_of_matrix model_name

    For Example:
    python3 main.py 1 0.001,0.002,0.003 samples_with_ployA_matrix
    late_onset_with_polyA_model

* model_number is an int from 1-4 such that:
1 - late-onset with polyA tail model.
2 - late-onset without polyA tail model.
3 - early-onset with polyA tail model.
4 - early-onset without polyA tail model.

** alphas_list: List of float with no spaces and a comma between them.

To run a prediction with an existing model file name to run should be "run_model.py", and 3 arguments are needed:
    1st arg - Model's saved joblib file
    2nd arg - Data file path of an existing kmers counting matrix with its corresponding response vectors
    3rd arg - Output files name

    For Example:
    python3 run_model.py .\models\1000_samp_early_onset_model_no_polyA.joblib
     .\data\matrices\1000_Samp_matrix_early_onset_no_polyA.csv 1000_samples_early_onset_no_polyA
